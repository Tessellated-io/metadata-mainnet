  "description": "Mantle LSP is a permissionless and non-custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle. Mantle LSP combines simple and modern design with robust risk management, and leverages extensive existing Mantle Ecosystem resources to deliver a highly rewarding experience and supercharges Mantleâ€™s status as a yield powerhouse. Mantle Staked Ether ($mETH) serves as the value-accumulating receipt token of Mantle LSP. Mantle LSP facilitates the pooling of ETH deposits from stakers, enabling their participation in rewards generated by Ethereum''s proof-of-stake (PoS) validation network. Stakers will receive receipt token $mETH, which represents a claim to the underlying staked principal and accumulated rewards. The receipt token can be utilized in other applications. When stakers unstake their ETH from Mantle LSP, they will be able to receive not only the sum of their staked ETH, but also any rewards gained from their staked funds during the staking period. Rewards may include a combination of issuance, priority fees, and maximal extractible value (MEV), and are shared among the stakers, LSP, and node operator (validation service provider).",
